## “Yoshoku no Nekoya” (Western Cuisine Cat Restaurant)
### 5 out of 5 Stars. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**So what is it all about?** 

*Food*


*The whole series is all about food. It's a chill-paced anime about travelers and adventurers from all around the "Other World" finding their way to 'Nekoya', a restaurant from another world where they are allowed to leave their worries and troubles behind and just dine on perfectly delicious food, all while being surrounded by decent company to eat with.* 

*This humble little restaurant would also end up helping Other Worlders resolve their troubles, and start their path to recover and healing through food.*

>My granddad was always saying… “Extra service at a restaurant should be provided with food, not money.” It was something like his last request. — Owner, Tenshu.
